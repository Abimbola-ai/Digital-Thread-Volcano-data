# Digital-Thread-Volcano-data
Creating a digital thread

A digital thread is a technique to 'stitch' the data that comes in disjoint tables, such that they can be put together logically. That is a task for this exercise.
Data sets provided:
We have been give 5 data sets, all of which related to one month's worth of readings taken at a live volcano site. The volcano was instrumented with multiple sensors in 10 different geographical points (nodes). Our goal is to combine and merge all of this into one digital thread, making it amenable for analysis.
Tasks:
1.0 Read all the needed input files
2.0 Plotting Sensor Time Series
3.0 Descriptive Analysis One data frame at a time 
4.0 Creating a Digital Thread from the data sets
5.0 Time Series based analysis
6.0 Correlations Analysis
7.0 Data Manipulations to Merge multiple data sets
8.0 Building A Battery Remaining-Life prediction model
